Pouta Cloud Course
This course will give a practical introduction to using CSC's cloud service cPouta.

cPouta cloud in short:

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offering from CSC
Based on the open source OpenStack software
Allows running your own virtual machines on CSC's infrastructure
Allows full control of applications and operating system
Permits direct connection to the Internet, providing new collaboration opportunities
With great power comes greater responsibilities; users must manage and secure their servers. 
The cPouta cloud service is meant for all fields of science. It allows users to solve computational challenges by means which have not previously been possible to run on CSC's other systems. Some examples where the cPouta cloud service is especially suitable are research projects that require complex application stacks or applications with a browser based user interface.

The course will consist of lectures and hands-on exercises.

Prerequisites:

The Pouta Cloud services are highly technical. Basic linux usage and/or system administration skills are recommended.
